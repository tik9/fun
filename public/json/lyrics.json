[{"lyrics":"Hey, where did we go\nDays when the rains came ?\nDown in the hollow\nPlaying a new game,\nLaughing and a-running, hey, hey,\nSkipping and a-jumping\nIn the misty morning fog with\nOur, our hearts a-thumping\nAnd you, my brown-eyed girl,\nYou, my brown-eyed girl.\n\nWhatever happened\nTo Tuesday and so slow\nGoing down to the old mine with a\nTransistor radio.\nStanding in the sunlight laughing\n\nHide behind a rainbow's wall,\nSlipping and a-sliding\nAll along the waterfall\nWith you, my brown-eyed girl,\nYou, my brown-eyed girl.\n\nDo you remember when we used to sing\nSha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah\nJust like that\nSha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah\nLa dee dah.\n\nSo hard to find my way\nNow that I'm all on my own.\nI saw you just the other day,\nMy, how you have grown!\nCast my memory back there, Lord,\nSometime I'm overcome thinking about\n\nMaking love in the green grass\nBehind the stadium\nWith you, my brown-eyed girl,\nYou, my brown-eyed girl.\n\nDo you remember when we used to sing\nSha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah\nLaying in the green grass\nSha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah\nDee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee\nSha la la la la la la la la la la la la\nDee dah la dee dah la dee dah la\nD-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d...","writer":"van
